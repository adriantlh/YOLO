# Weights path inside the container. Mount your local file/dir to /app/serve/weights.
# Example when you mount ./serve/weights -> /app/serve/weights:
# YOLO_WEIGHT_PATH=/app/serve/weights/model.pt

# Tip: place a weights file named 'model.pt' in ./serve/weights and
# uncomment the line above so the API and /ui return real detections.
